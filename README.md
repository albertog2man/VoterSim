# VoterSim
______________________
A program used to calculate vote results from an array of politicians and voters.

##How it works
______________________
A user enters a series of politicians and voters each with a name and a political party of choice.
The politicians have the option of choosing between democrat and republicans while the voters
can be a much greater list of party affiliations. Once all the voter and politicians are added you can 
see complete list of them or update their name/party once complete making any modifications 
the votes can be ran. Depending on the voters political affiliations it will run a probability system
on which party they are most likely to choose and from that party it adds one vote to a random popitician. This is done for however many voters there are.
